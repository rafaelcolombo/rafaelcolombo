### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael Colombo and I'm new on Programming! Started last May as a hobby and now I'm enjoying and learning everything I can. I'm Electrical Engineer graduated in 2005, so numbers, math and logic runs my blood.

I'm studying Python and all its ramifications, like Web Scraping, Machine Learning, Data Science etc. I hope to learn even more to be part of this amazing community.
